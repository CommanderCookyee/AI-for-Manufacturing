Wafer Analysis 

### Introduction
Wafer manufacturing is the process of creating silicon wafers that are used as the base for integrated circuits (ICs) and other microelectronic devices. The manufacturing process involves a series of steps, including crystal growth, slicing, polishing, and doping, among others. The wafer manufacturing industry is dominated by a few major players, including Intel, Samsung, TSMC, and GlobalFoundries. These companies specialize in producing high-quality wafers for a wide range of applications, including smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices. Additionally, there are also many smaller players in the industry that provide niche products and services to the semiconductor industry

### Why Semi-Conductors
Major semiconductor companies like Intel, Samsung, TSMC, and GlobalFoundries supply wafers that are crucial for manufacturing microchips and electronic components in various consumer products. Wafer quality affects production costs, and defects or inconsistencies can lead to manufacturing issues, lower yields, and increased costs, which may result in higher prices for consumers. Conversely, lower wafer production costs may enable semiconductor companies to offer competitive pricing and lower prices for consumers. Therefore, the cost of wafer production can have a significant impact on the final price of consumer products in the industry.
